PyDinsky team repository for McGill Physics Hackathon 2020

## Why Pydinski
Bare with us. We wanted to create generative art with user input and elements of randomness. We thought [Wassily Kadinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky) because of his contributions to the early concepts of abstract art and his use of bold colors.

## The "Physics"
Every time you generate an image it will be different. We implemented randoms walk methods that follow a **Boltzmann distribution** and are seeded with a temperature. We plot the trace of walkers using a color scheme that matches the given temperature.

## Use your favorite cities to generate images
The color schemes used for the walkers are generated using the current temperature of the cities of your choice. A cold scheme for a colder day and a warm scheme for a blazing hot day.
